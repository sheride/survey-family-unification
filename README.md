Guide to files:
`symmetry_break.wl` -> a small Mathematica package dedicated to using LieArt 2.0 [2] to compute non-Abelian and Abelian symmetry breakings as defined in [1]
`survey.nb` -> a Mathematica notebook exhibiting the derivation of all quantitative results found in [1] (using `symmetry_break.wl`)
`hists.ipynb` -> a Python Jupyer notebook importing `.txt` data files outputted by `survey.nb` (found in `./data`) and producing the figures found in [1] (saved in `./hists`)
